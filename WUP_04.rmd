# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data is in the file GSScsv.csv and came from the 2018 General Social Survey.  The question to answer is to resolve this hypothesis.  
$H_0$ There is no difference between the average score on the WORDSUM test and level of schooling DEGREE  
$H_a$ There is a significant difference in average score on the WORDSUM test between at least two levels of DEGREE  

# Methods

<!--Mention that you intend to use chatGPT to the greatest extent possible. Give credit to chatGPT when you use it to create code in your report. Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(GSScsv,aes(x=DEGREE,y=WORDSUM))

basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```

  There is a significant difference shown in the box plot as GRADUATES  have a notably larger upper quartile than the HIGHSCHOOL third quartile. As is the same relationship between JUNIOR COLLEGE and LT HIGH SCHOOL.
  

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->


```{r}
favstats(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=GSScsv)
```

  The GRADUATE group has a Q1 of 10, which is larger than LT HIGH SCHOOL'S Q1 of 7 and Q3 of 8.25. The HIGH SCHOOL has a median of 9 despite its large population. This proves that there is a significant difference between values of each group.

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->


```{r}
model1 <- aov(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=GSScsv)
summary.aov(model1)
```
  The p-value of 0.000236 proves that there is a significant difference in statistics between these results. Further testing will be required.
  
```{r}
#we specify the margins starting at the bottom and proceeding clockwise - thus 8.7 is the left side margin to hold the names of the factors
par(mar = c(3, 17, 2, 2))
plot(TukeyHSD(model1, conf.level=0.98),las=2)
```

  This graph makes the difference clear between LT HIGH SCHOOL-GRADUATE AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE as the HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE mean is lower than zero. This signifies a significant difference between DEGREES.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
